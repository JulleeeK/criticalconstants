# criticalconstants
The files for my website criticalconstants.jkraemer.eu

The website runs of python Flask and with a mysql database in the background. The data can be found in the dump file and has been provided by NIST (public domain, 2004). If you want to run this code you'll have to insert your database information in two seperate places.

This might not be totally up-to-date since i sometimes update the website. If it is not, just wait and eventually it will be updated here as well, or open up an issue if its urgent.
